                        Avherald-RSS

  A Python script for parsing the avherald articles into RSS.

Requires Python 2.3.  (Uses the datetime module for timestamps.)

  ======  ======  ======  ======  ======  ======  ======  ======
  
For this to work you need to copy the file 'PyRSS2Gen.py' from
Dalke Scientific Software, LLC into the same directory.
http://www.dalkescientific.com/Python/PyRSS2Gen.html

The script parses the time using parsedatetime, which you need in
the same directory as well. You can get the latest version here:
http://code.google.com/p/parsedatetime/

You can change the filter options by changing the 'opt=' parameter
at the beginning of the script.

Be sure to replace the path_to_rss_file with a working one.
Enjoy!

NOTE FOR FEVERÂ°-USERS (http://www.feedafever.com)
=================================================
You may run into double- or even multiple entries of a single article.
This is caused by the way Fever handles the guid (a kind of
identifier) of an article in contrast to this script. If an article
at avherald.com is updated, the script will generate a completely new
guid for it and therefore Fever considers it as a whole new article -
with the advance that it will be marked as new.
You can give it a try like this, but sometimes there are two or more
"same" articles right next to each other. The newest one really is
the newest one, the other ones are older versions stored in the DB,
although they aren't in the .xml-file itself anymore.
Optional, you can try the replacement version of the guid (just place
a "#" in front of the original line beginning with "guid =" and
delete the "#" in front of the second one) which basically makes the
guid a static value. With this, an updated article will be considered
as updated but NOT marked as new. Additionally, there are no more
multiple entries.
