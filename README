                        Avherald-RSS

  A Python script for parsing the avherald articles into RSS.

Requires Python 2.3.  (Uses the datetime module for timestamps.)

For this to work you need to copy the file 'PyRSS2Gen.py' from
Dalke Scientific Software, LLC into the same directory.
http://www.dalkescientific.com/Python/PyRSS2Gen.html

The script parses the time using parsedatetime, which you need in
the same directory as well. You can get the latest version here:
http://code.google.com/p/parsedatetime/

You can change the filter options by changing the 'opt=' parameter
in the avherald.com url.

Be sure to replace the path_to_rss_file with a working one.
Enjoy!
